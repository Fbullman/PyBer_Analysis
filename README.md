# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to 
help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine 
affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Analysis and results
The data shows that rural cities have the least number of rides with a total of 125, Suburban has 625 and Urban 1625.
The cost of ride-sharing rises as the distance from the city center increases, which also impacts the number of total riders per city type and its accesibilty as only 78 people used ride-sharing services in Rural areas when compared to Urban areas with a total of 2405, as shown on image bellow:
