# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to 
help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine 
affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Analysis and results
The data shows that rural cities have the least number of rides with a total of 125, Suburban has 625 and Urban 1625.
The cost of ride-sharing rises as the distance from the city center increases, which also impacts the number of total riders per city type and its accesibilty as only 78 people used ride-sharing services in Rural areas when compared to Urban areas with a total of 2405, as shown on image bellow:

The analysis shows the highest average fare per ride in rural cities, indicating a potential chance for increase revenue, compared to Urban city types wich has the lowest average fare per ride. Other metric that we can see in this dataframe is the average fare per driver, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.

A Line chart helps the  visualitaion of the analysis of the total fares from January 1, 2019 to April 29th, 2019 for each of the city types.

Further analysis would have to be performed to truly identify trends based on time of year, ans or week, as four months-worth of data can't provide the full context.


## Summary
Based on the above analysis and results, It is recommended:

- Increase number of drivers in rural areas and decrease recruitment marketing in urban areas. (This recommendation would influenced by turnover rates of employees.)
- Introduce a flat rate fare to make the service affordable in rural areas, making the service more accessible to those who may be living in underserved service areas while still allowing PyBer to ptofi.
- Increase marketing efforts across the board, focusing on the services affordability and short wait times based on driver availability.
