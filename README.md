# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to 
help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine 
affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Analysis and results
The data shows that rural cities have the least number of rides with a total of 125, Suburban has 625 and Urban 1625.
The cost of ride-sharing rises as the distance from the city center increases, which also impacts the number of total riders per city type and its accesibilty as only 78 people used ride-sharing services in Rural areas when compared to Urban areas with a total of 2405, as shown on image bellow:

The analysis shows the highest average fare per ride in rural cities,indicating a potential chance of increase revenue, compared to Urban city types wich has the lowest average fare per ride. Other metric that we can see in this dataframe is the average fare per driver, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.

A Line chart helps the  visualitaion of the analysis of the total fares from January 1, 2019 to April 29th, 2019 for each of the city types.
